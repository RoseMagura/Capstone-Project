#FEDN Capstone Project

##Introduction

Hello! This repo contains the files for a trip planning website. It uses
the Geonames, Weatherbit, and Pixabay APIs to get relevant information about
a destination that the user can choose. Then you can see weather information
and an image about that destination. It could be used when planning a fun
vacation.

##How to Run

Just clone the repo, download, and then run using Webpack.
You can use the command 'npm run build-prod' and then 'npm run build'
to get the production mode running and then open a browser and go to
localhost:8000/ to see the webpage.

##Bonus Features

In addition to basic functionality, this project includes an option to
set the end date of the trip and then see the length of the trip.
